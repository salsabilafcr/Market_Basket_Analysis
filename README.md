# Market Basket Analysis
In the context of online retail businesses, understanding customer buying patterns is key to optimising marketing and sales strategies. Therefore, a Market Basket Analysis is conducted that provides a deep understanding of customer purchasing patterns and associations between products. With this understanding, companies can design more targeted and effective marketing strategies, such as product bundling or joint promotions, to increase sales and customer satisfaction in the competitive online retail market.

## Project Strategics
Market Basket analysis was performed using Python, utilising the appropriate apriori algorithm to identify associations between products purchased at the same time. Online retail transaction data is processed and analysed using Market Basket Analysis techniques. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and MLxtend were used for the implementation of this analysis.

## Analysis Relts
From the analysis, some interesting insights were found:
- The Red Hanging Heart T-light Holder product was purchased in 5.9% of the total transactions, demonstrating the product's popularity among customers.
- Among the buyers of the Red Hanging Heart T-light Holder, 72% of them also purchased the White Hanging Heart T-light Holder. This indicates a strong association between the two products.
- There is a strong association between the Red Hanging Heart T-light Holder and the White Hanging Heart T-light Holder, with the probability of both products being purchased together in a single transaction being 4 times greater than the probability of being purchased separately.
