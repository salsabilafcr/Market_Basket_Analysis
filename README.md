# Market Basket Analysis
This project aims to perform market basket analysis on online retail dataset using the Python programming language. The data used includes transactions from the period January 2010 to December 2010. This analysis provides valuable insights into customer buying patterns and associations between specific products. With this understanding, companies can design more effective marketing strategies, such as product bundling, cross-selling or up-selling product promotions, to increase sales and customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
In the competitive field of online retail, understanding customer buying patterns is key to improving marketing and sales strategies. Therefore, in-depth analysis is required to identify associations between products and concurrent purchase opportunities in a single transaction.

## Objectives
- Identified the products most frequently purchased by customers and measured the proportion of total transactions.
- Analysed the relationship between specific products and measured the chance of concurrent purchases.
- Clarified strong associations between specific products and evaluated their impact on sales and marketing strategies.

## Project Strategics
Market Basket analysis was performed using Python, utilising the appropriate apriori algorithm to identify associations between products purchased at the same time. Online retail transaction data is processed and analysed using Market Basket Analysis techniques. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and MLxtend were used for the implementation of this analysis.

## Analysis Results

From the analysis, some interesting insights were found:
- The Red Hanging Heart T-light Holder product was purchased in 5.9% of the total transactions, demonstrating the product's popularity among customers.
- Among the buyers of the Red Hanging Heart T-light Holder, 72% of them also purchased the White Hanging Heart T-light Holder. This indicates a strong association between the two products.
- There is a strong association between the Red Hanging Heart T-light Holder and the White Hanging Heart T-light Holder, with the probability of both products being purchased together in a single transaction being 4 times greater than the probability of being purchased separately.
